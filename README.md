**With the release of jsPanel version 2 this extra bootstrap version is more or less obsolete since jsPanel version 2 has bootstrap support built in!**

**This jsPanel version is not maintained anymore!**

**jsPanel for bootstrap** is basically the same as jsPanel but **optimized for use in a bootstrap environment**. In general this means that jsPanel for bootstrap makes use of native bootstrap components in order to adapt to the used bootstrap theme.
