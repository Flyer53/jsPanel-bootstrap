###NEWS:###

+ 2014-05-13 **jsPanel version 1.3.0 released**: Most important change is the new **option.rtl** that adds support for RTL text direction on individual jsPanels.

+ Further changes in 1.3.0 are a bugfix in **option.modal** when a modal jsPanel is appended directly to the <code>body</code> element and overall improvements in the code base.

---

**jsPanel for bootstrap** is basically the same as jsPanel but **optimized for use in a bootstrap environment**. In general this means that jsPanel for bootstrap makes use of native bootstrap components in order to adapt to the used bootstrap theme.
