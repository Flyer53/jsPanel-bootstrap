###NEWS:###

**With the release of jsPanel version 2 this extra bootstrap version is more or less obsolete since jsPanel version 2 has bootstrap support built in!**

---

+ **jsPanel-bootstrap version 1.4.0 released**

Version 1.4 incorporates a bunch of changes and improvements. Please see the CHANGELOG.md for details.

---

**jsPanel for bootstrap** is basically the same as jsPanel but **optimized for use in a bootstrap environment**. In general this means that jsPanel for bootstrap makes use of native bootstrap components in order to adapt to the used bootstrap theme.
